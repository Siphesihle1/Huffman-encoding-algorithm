# Huffman-encoding-algorithm
Two programs one called encode, which compresses text, and the other called decode, which decompresses the text using the output from the encode program. All of this is based on the huffman encoding algorithm.

Instructions to run the programs
1. Change 'comp' to an executable. chmod 755 comp
2. Run comp. ./comp
3. echo <Your text> | ./encode | ./decode (Returns your original text)
